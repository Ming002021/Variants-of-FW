Describing a summary of the model: 
Termination Status: OPTIMAL 
Primal Status: FEASIBLE_POINT 
Message from the solver: Solution is optimal

I am solving an LP problem over D to get the Away direction now:

The gap is 0.24142931327391914 in this iteration
Toward Step is selected 
Step-size gained is 1.0

In iteration 1, the objective function value of the solution gained is 8.916635225705232


This is the iteration 2:
