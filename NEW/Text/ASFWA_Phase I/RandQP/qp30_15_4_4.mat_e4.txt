The  Away-Steps Frank-Wolfe Algorithm in Atom Version with Phase I is Starting:

This is the iteration 1: 
I am solving an LP problem over feasible region to get the Toward direction now:
Describing a summary of the model: 
Termination Status: OPTIMAL 
Primal Status: FEASIBLE_POINT 
Message from the solver: Solution is optimal

I am solving an LP problem over D to get the Away direction now:

The gap is 0.15342503921197115 in this iteration
Toward Step is selected 
Step-size gained is 1.0

In iteration 1, the objective function value of the solution gained is 6.6010280149206535


This is the iteration 2: 
I am solving an LP problem over feasible region to get the Toward direction now:
Describing a summary of the model: 
Termination Status: OPTIMAL 
Primal Status: FEASIBLE_POINT 
Message from the solver: Solution is optimal

I am solving an LP problem over D to get the Away direction now:

The gap is 0.0 in this iteration

Termination condition with respect to epsilon is satisfied with iteration 2 and final value 6.6010280149206535
