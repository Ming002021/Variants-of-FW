Using Phase I method to get a starting point: 
Describing a summary of the model: 
Termination Status: OPTIMAL 
Primal Status: FEASIBLE_POINT 
Message from the solver: Solution is optimal
Objective Value: 0.0

The value of the objective function of the starting solution is 20.0 

The  Away-Steps Frank-Wolfe Algorithm with Phase I is Starting:

This is the iteration 1: 
I am solving an LP problem over feasible region to get the Toward direction now:
Describing a summary of the model: 
Termination Status: OPTIMAL 
Primal Status: FEASIBLE_POINT 
Message from the solver: Solution is optimal

I am solving an LP problem over feasible region to get the Away  direction now:
Describing a summary of the model: 
Termination Status: OPTIMAL 
Primal Status: FEASIBLE_POINT 
Message from the solver: Solution is optimal

The gap is 0.0 in this iteration

Termination condition with respect to epsilon is satisfied with iteration 1 and final value 20.0
