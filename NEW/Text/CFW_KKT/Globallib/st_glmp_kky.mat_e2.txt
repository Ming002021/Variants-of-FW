Using KKT method to get a starting point: 
Describing a summary of the model: 
Termination Status: OPTIMAL 
Primal Status: FEASIBLE_POINT 
Message from the solver: Solution is optimal
Objective Value of this KKT conditions model: 0.0
The value of the objective function of the starting solution is 1.5000000000000018 

The  Classical Frank-Wolfe Algorithm with KKT is Starting:

This is the iteration 1:
