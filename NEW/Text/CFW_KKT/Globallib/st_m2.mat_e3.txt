Using KKT method to get a starting point: 
Describing a summary of the model: 
Termination Status: OPTIMAL 
Primal Status: FEASIBLE_POINT 
Message from the solver: Solution is optimal
Objective Value of this KKT conditions model: 0.0
The value of the objective function of the starting solution is 3.6873923257609275e6 

The  Classical Frank-Wolfe Algorithm with KKT is Starting:

This is the iteration 1: 
I am solving an LP problem over feasible region to get the Toward direction now:
Describing a summary of the model: 
Termination Status: OPTIMAL 
Primal Status: FEASIBLE_POINT 
Message from the solver: Solution is optimal

The gap is 4.500851177298088e6 in this iteration
Step-size gained is 1.0

In iteration 1, the objective function value of the solution gained is -856648.8186850672


This is the iteration 2: 
I am solving an LP problem over feasible region to get the Toward direction now:
Describing a summary of the model: 
Termination Status: OPTIMAL 
Primal Status: FEASIBLE_POINT 
Message from the solver: Solution is optimal

The gap is -8.429585496864255e-11 in this iteration

Termination condition with respect to epsilon is satisfied with iteration 2 and final value -856648.8186850672
