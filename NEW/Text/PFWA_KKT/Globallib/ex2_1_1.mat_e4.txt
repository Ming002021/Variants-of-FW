Using KKT method to get a starting point: 
Describing a summary of the model: 
Termination Status: OPTIMAL 
Primal Status: FEASIBLE_POINT 
Message from the solver: Solution is optimal
Objective Value of this KKT conditions model: 0.0
The value of the objective function of the starting solution is 50.95125 

The  Pairwise Frank-Wolfe Algorithm in Atom Version with KKT is Starting:

This is the iteration 1: 
I am solving an LP problem over feasible region to get the Toward direction now:

I am solving an LP problem over D to get the Away direction now:

The gap is 0.0 in this iteration

Termination condition with respect to epsilon is satisfied with iteration 1 and final value 50.95125
