Describing a summary of the model: 
Termination Status: OPTIMAL 
Primal Status: FEASIBLE_POINT 
Message from the solver: Solution is optimal

I am solving an LP problem over D to get the Away direction now:

The gap is 0.12763278871444456 in this iteration
Step-size gained is 1.0

In iteration 1, the objective function value of the solution gained is 1.479586351290175


This is the iteration 2: 
I am solving an LP problem over feasible region to get the Toward direction now:
Describing a summary of the model: 
Termination Status: OPTIMAL 
Primal Status: FEASIBLE_POINT 
Message from the solver: Solution is optimal

I am solving an LP problem over D to get the Away direction now:

The gap is 0.0 in this iteration

Termination condition with respect to epsilon is satisfied with iteration 2 and final value 1.479586351290175
