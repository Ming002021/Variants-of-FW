# Variants-of-FW

-FW_1ed contains Julia scripts that allow us to see the final results when implementing the algorithm on the instance, including the final solution,  the number of iteration and the value of objective function at the final solution.

-NEW contains Julia scripts that allow us to see the results of each iteration as we implement the algorithm on the instance.

-NEW_RT  contains Julia scripts to get the running time of the algorithm implemented on a instance.
-mat contains all benchmark instances we used

-Results contains all output results.

-See ReadMe.txt in each folder please.
