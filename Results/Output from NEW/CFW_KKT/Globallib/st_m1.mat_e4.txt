Primal Status: FEASIBLE_POINT 
Message from the solver: Solution is optimal
Objective Value of this KKT conditions model: 0.0
The value of the objective function of the starting solution is 1.4554025447863434e6 

The  Classical Frank-Wolfe Algorithm with KKT is Starting:

This is the iteration 1: 
I am solving an LP problem over feasible region to get the Toward direction now:
Describing a summary of the model: 
Termination Status: OPTIMAL 
Primal Status: FEASIBLE_POINT 
Message from the solver: Solution is optimal

The gap is 1.8256662027512523e6 in this iteration
Step-size gained is 1.0

In iteration 1, the objective function value of the solution gained is -461356.93887835246


This is the iteration 2: 
I am solving an LP problem over feasible region to get the Toward direction now:
Describing a summary of the model:
